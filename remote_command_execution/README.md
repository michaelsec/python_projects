Remote Command Execution Scripts

These scripts allow for remote command execution between a client and a server using Python's socket programming.

Server Script:
The server script sets up a TCP socket, listens for incoming connections from clients, and executes the commands sent by the clients. The output of the command execution is sent back to the clients.

Usage:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the server script.

3. Run the server script

Client Script:
The client script connects to the server and sends commands for remote execution. It receives the output of the executed command from the server and displays it on the client-side.

Usage:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.

2. Navigate to the directory containing the client script.

3. Run the client script

4. The script will prompt you to enter a command.

5. Enter a command and press Enter to send it to the server for execution.

6. The output of the executed command will be displayed on the client-side.

Note:
Replace <server_ip> in the client script with the actual IP address where the server script is running.

Security and Ethics:
1. Use these scripts responsibly and ensure that you have proper authorization and consent before executing commands remotely on any system.

2. These scripts are provided as a starting point and may require additional security measures and error handling to be used in production environments.

3. It's recommended to use established and secure protocols like SSH for remote command execution in a real-world scenario.
