Python Port Scanner:
This is a simple Python port scanner script that allows you to scan a range of ports on a specified host. It uses the socket module in Python to establish a TCP connection with each port and determine if it is open or closed.

Usage:
Copy the script code into a Python file (e.g., port_scanner.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the Python file is located.
Run the script by executing the following command: python port_scanner.py
You will be prompted to enter the host (IP address or domain name) that you want to scan.
The script will then scan a range of ports (specified by start_port and end_port) on the provided host.
The script will output the status (open or closed) for each port.

Aditional Notes:
Feel free to modify the start_port and end_port variables according to your scanning requirements.

It is important to ensure that you have the necessary permissions to perform port scanning on the target host. Always ensure you have the appropriate authorization before conducting any scanning activities.
