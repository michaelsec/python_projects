# SSH Brute Force Script

This is a Python script that demonstrates a simple brute force approach for SSH logins using the Paramiko library.


1. Open the script file `ssh_brute_force.py` in a text editor.

2. Modify the following variables to fit your target SSH server:


hostname = 'example.com'
username = 'admin'
password_list = ['password1', 'password2', 'password3', 'admin123']

hostname: Replace 'example.com' with the IP address or hostname of the target SSH server.
username: Replace 'admin' with the username you want to use for login.
password_list: Replace the list of passwords with the ones you want to try during the brute force process.
Save the changes to the script.


Note: Brute forcing SSH logins without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. This script should only be used for educational purposes or on systems you have proper authorization to access.
