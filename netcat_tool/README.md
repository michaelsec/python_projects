Python Netcat Tool:
The Python Netcat Tool provides a simple client-server implementation using sockets for sending and receiving messages or executing commands remotely.

Client:
The client script (netcat_client.py) connects to a specified server and allows you to send messages or commands.

Usage:
python netcat_client.py <host> [-p <port>]
<host>: Target host to connect.
-p, --port: Target port to connect (default: 80).

Example usage:
python netcat_client.py localhost -p 1234

Once connected, you can enter messages or commands that will be sent to the server. The server will process the input and return the response.

Server:
The server script (netcat_server.py) listens for incoming connections from clients and executes commands sent by the client.

Usage:
python netcat_server.py <host> [-p <port>]
<host>: Host to bind the server.
-p, --port: Port to bind the server (default: 80).

Example usage:
python netcat_server.py localhost -p 1234

Once the server is running, it will wait for client connections. When a client connects, it will execute the commands received from the client and send back the output.
